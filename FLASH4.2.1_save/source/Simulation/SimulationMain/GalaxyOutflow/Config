# SS : This is the configuration file for Stirring Turbulence 
# with magnetic fields + scalars. 
# Physical viscosity, scalar diffusivity and magnetic resistivity 
# can be optionally turned on. The MHD solver for the magnetic field
# is turned on when compiling the .setup script.
# ./setup ...... +usm 
# StirMain/StirScalar is the directory for using scalars. 
# When cosmology is on all length have to be multiplied by
# a to get physical units.
