# Configuration file for a sod-like problem in spherical coordinates.  The idea
# is that we want to propagate a planar shock in spherical coordinates and see
# if it stays planar.  This is effectively a test of the fictitous forces.

## If we were specifying additional source directories for curvilinear support
## directly, rather than relying on setup and various Config files to do the right thing,
## We would use the following:

##REQUIRES Grid/GridMain/paramesh/Paramesh2
##REQUIRES Grid/GridMain/paramesh/Paramesh2/monotonic

###REQUIRES Grid/GridMain/paramesh/Paramesh3
###REQUIRES Grid/GridMain/paramesh/interpolation/Paramesh3/prolong
###REQUIRES Grid/GridMain/paramesh/interpolation/prolong

# The following isn't really a data file, but this will get it copied.
# setup should then use it to generate amr_runtime_parameters.
# This will be used in case we set up Paramesh 4.0 in LIBRARY mode or use Paramesh4dev.
