!! NAME
!!
!!  Particles_sinkAdvanceParticles
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!  call Particles_sinkAdvanceParticles(real, INTENT(in) :: dr_dt)
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  Updates sink particle postions and velocities based on gravitational accelerations,
!!  using Leapfrog or Euler, depending on the user's choice There is also a special
!!  implementation of Leapfrog for cosmological simulations.
!!  This routine performs subcycling on sink-sink interactions, in case of very close
!!  encounters and highly eccentric orbits.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!   dr_dt - the current time step
!!
