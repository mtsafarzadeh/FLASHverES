D eint1Switch  OBSOLETE - a switch which tries to ensure that internal energy calculations for component 1
D &            in a multiple-temperature setup
D &            maintain sufficient precision. Important only if total energy for this component
D &            is dominated by bulk kinetic energy.
D & A value of -1 means to use the value of eintSwitch for eint1Switch.
D eint2Switch  OBSOLETE - a switch which tries to ensure that internal energy calculations for component 2
D &            in a multiple-temperature setup
D &            maintain sufficient precision. See eint1Switch.
D & A value of -1 means to use the value of eintSwitch for eint2Switch.
D eint3Switch  OBSOLETE - a switch which tries to ensure that internal energy calculations for component 3
D &            in a multiple-temperature setup
D &            maintain sufficient precision. See eint1Switch.
D & A value of -1 means to use the value of eintSwitch for eint3Switch.

D eos_combinedTempRule determines for multiTemp Eos implementations what a call to
D & Eos will return in the EOS_TEMP part of eosData, when Eos is called in a mode
D & for which EOS_TEMP is an output and different component temperatures can be returned.
D & 1 for ion temperature EOS_TEMPION;
D & 2 for electron temperature EOS_TEMPELE;
D & 3 for radiation temperature EOS_TEMPRAD;
D & 0 for the temperature that would result in the same
D &   specific internal energy as given if all components where
D &   equilibrated at the same temperature, which may be expensive
D &   to compute;
D & -10 for undefined, i.e., we do not care what is returned.
D & Currently only implemented for Multitype Eos.
PARAMETER eos_combinedTempRule INTEGER -10 [-10, 0 ... 3]

# For debugging - some Eos routines put diagnostic info into these
# variables if they are defined.
VARIABLE TITE  # Temp. ions / temp. electrons
VARIABLE PIPE  # Pres. ions / pres. electrons
