!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  Traces the movement of the current collection of active 3D cartesian rays through
!!  one block for 2D cylindrical geometries. On exit, each ray has either:
!!
!!            i)  reached a different (yet unknown) 2D cylindrical block
!!           ii)  has been absorbed -> is nonexistent
!!          iii)  has reached the domain boundary and exited -> is nonexistent.
!!
!!  The 3-dimensional shape of the 2D cylindrical geometry is approximated as a 3D wedge,
!!  whose width extends in the y-direction. The y-direction constitutes the linear angular
!!  approximation. The smaller the width of the wedge, the more accurate the cylindrical
!!  representation becomes. Rays hitting on one of the wedge's y-directional boundaries
!!  stay in the same 2D cylindrical block and automatically jump to the other y-directional
!!  boundary, thus mimicking travel inside a cylindrical shell. The y-directional boundaries
!!  are defined by two lines 'y = m * x' and 'y = - m * x' with opposite slope, whose value
!!  depends on the wedges angle of aperture. The following picture shows the wedge with
!!  origin at the 2D cylindrical domain origin:

!!       |                                            *        |
!!       |                                   *        |        |

!!       |        *        |        |        |        |         
!!       |                 *        |        |        |        |  X = 2D cylindrical
!!       |                          *        |        |        |      domain boundary
!!       |                                   *        |        |
!!       |                                            *        |
!!       |                                                     *  <--- y = - m * x wedge boundary

!!
!!  The z-direction is the same for either the 2D cylindrical or the 3D cartesian picture.
