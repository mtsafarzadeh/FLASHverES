!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  Returns a collection of square grid points for a 3D beam. The square grid has to be
!!  set up beforehand to be able to use this routine. The total number of square grid
!!  points of the square grid is cut into several equally sized arrays, each of which
!!  is returned consecutively by a call to this routine.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!  semiAxisMajor      : the elliptical major semiaxis of the 3D beam
!!  semiAxisMinor      : the elliptical minor semiaxis of the 3D beam
!!  nTicsSemiAxisMajor : # of grid positions along the major semiaxis
!!  nTicsSemiAxisMinor : # of grid positions along the minor semiaxis
!!  delta              : the separation distance between two consecutive tics
!!  startGrid          : if true, the grid points will start from the beginning 
!!  maxGridPoints      : the maximum number of grid points that can be returned
!!  moreGridPoints     : if true, more grid points are expected
!!  nGridPoints        : the actual number of grid points returned
!!  xGrid              : the major semiaxis based coordinates of the grid points
!!  yGrid              : the minor semiaxis based coordinates of the grid points
