!!  ed_createRays2DRec
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!  call ed_createRays2DRec (integer, intent (in) :: blockCount, 
!!                           integer, intent (in) :: blockList (:), 
!!                           real,    intent (in) :: timeStep,   
!!                           real,    intent (in) :: timeSimulation)
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  Generates rays and places them in their initial blocks for those geometries consisting
!!  formally of 2D rectangular grids (cartesian + cylindrical). On exit, all rays hitting
!!  the domain boundary have been generated for the current processor. Their block ID's are
!!  not ordered as the outer loop is over all beams.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!  blockCount     : Number of blocks on current processor
!!  blockList      : All block ID numbers
!!  timeStep       : current timestep value
!!  timeSimulation : current simulation time

!
!     ...Create all rays for the current beam. This is done by looping over all possible
!        grid points in both the target and lens linear areas.
!
!        For each ray we obtain a global x,y position for both the lens and target line.
!        The ray can be represented by a vector 'R' with tail point 'L' on the lens and head
!        point 'T' at the target. It therefore lays on a line in 2D, given by the following
!        parametric line vector equation:
!
!                                      P = L + w * R
!                                        = L + w * (T - L)
!
!        where 'w' is a real parameter that can attain all possible values. In particular we
!        must have:
!
!                              w >= 0    -->   ray moves from L to T
!
!        Having the ray line equation, we now must see if and where the domain boundaries
!        are crossed. For each domain boundary we have very simple line equations:
!
!                     domain y-lines  -->  line equations: x = xminDomain and x = xmaxDomain
!                     domain x-lines  -->  line equations: y = yminDomain and y = ymaxDomain
!
!        Lets assume we have a line equation x = a. Then we find the 'w' value, such that Px = a
!        is on the plane. We obtain from the ray line equation:
!
!                                    w = (a - Lx) / (Tx - Lx)
!
!        From this we get the corresponding Py coordinate:
!
!                                   Py = Ly + w * (Ty - Ly)
!
!        Significance of the 'w' values:
!
!                         i)     w < 0  -->  ray moves away from the domain         (exclude)
!                        ii)     w > 1  -->  target point is outside of the domain  (exclude)
!                       iii)     w = 0  -->  lens area touches domain boundary      (exclude)
!                        iv)     w = 1  -->  target area touches domain boundary    (ok,can happen)
!                         v) 0 < w < 1  -->  proper lens and target positions       (ok)
!
!        If the 'w' value is ok, we have to check, if the point (Py) is actually contained on the
!        domain y-face. If yes, add this 'w' to the allowed w-list. To find the relevant 'w' we
!        need to pick the smallest 'w' from the allowed w-list. If the list turns out to be
!        empty, then we know that the ray is moving away from the domain. This should never
!        happen as the target area is supposed to be entirely contained in the domain.
!
!        For 2D cylindrical grids we have to make sure that all rays land within the domain.
!        All rays with negative target R-coordinates must be mirrored along the R = 0 line
!        (z-axis) to ensure proper landing inside the 2D cylindrical grid.
