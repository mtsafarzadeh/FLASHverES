!!                             integer, intent (in) :: blockList (:),

!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  Generates 3D cartesian rays and places them in their initial 3D wedge blocks for 2D cylindrical
!!  geometries. The 3D wedge blocks are considered an approximation to the true 3-dimensional
!!  cylindrical geometry.

!!
!!
!!
!!  The z-direction is the same for either the 2D cylindrical or the 3D cartesian picture.
!!  The ray line equations are 3D cartesian equations and we need to know at what angle they
!!  hit R-domain boundary in the (x,y) plane. All rays will be placed initially exactly
!!  along the wedge middle line (the R or x axis). The different incident angles of the rays
!!  on the 3-dimensional cylinder with radius R will be reflected in their different velocity
!!  components.
!!
!!  On exit, all rays hitting the domain boundary have been generated for the current processor.
!!  Their 2D cylindrical block ID's are not ordered as the outer loop is over all beams.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!  blockCount     : Number of blocks on current processor
!!  blockList      : All block ID numbers
!!  timeStep       : current timestep value
!!  timeSimulation : current simulation time

!     ...Create all rays for the current beam. This is done by looping over all possible
!        grid points in both the target and lens areas.
!
!        For each ray we obtain a global x,y,z position for both the lens and target area.
!        The ray can be represented by a vector 'R' with tail point 'L' on the lens and head
!        point 'T' at the target. It therefore lays on a line in 3D, given by the following
!        parametric line vector equation:
!
!                                      P = L + w * R
!                                        = L + w * (T - L)
!
!        where 'w' is a real parameter that can attain all possible values. In particular we
!        must have:
!
!                              w >= 0    -->   ray moves from L to T
!
!        Having the ray line equation, we now must see if and where the domain boundaries
!        are crossed. For each domain boundary we have the following equations:
!
!                     domain  R-face   -->  curved equation: x^2 + y^2 = xmaxDomain^2
!                     domain xy-faces  -->  plane equations: z = yminDomain and z = ymaxDomain
!
!        We have thus two kind of surface equations to deal with:
!
!        1) Plane equation z = a. We find the 'w' value, such that Pz = a is on the plane.
!           We obtain from the ray line equation:
!
!                                    w = (a - Lz) / (Tz - Lz)
!
!        2) Curved equation x^2 + y^2 = a. We find the 'w' value, such that Px^2 + Py^2 = a
!           is on the circle. From the ray line equation we get the following quadratic equation
!           in w:
!
!           [(Tx-Lx)^2 + (Ty-Ly)^2] w^2 + 2[Lx(Tx-Lx) + Ly(Ty-Ly)] w + [Lx^2 + Ly^2 - a] = 0
!
!           with two possible solutions. Note the extra possibility of complex 'w', indicating
!           a miss of the domain.
!
!        Significance of the possible 'w' values:
!
!                     i)     w < 0        -->  ray moves away from the domain         (exclude)
!                    ii)     w > 1        -->  target point is outside of the domain  (exclude)
!                   iii)     w = 0        -->  lens area touches domain boundary      (exclude)
!                    iv)     w = complex  -->  ray misses circular domain boundary    (exclude)
!                     v)     w = 1        -->  target area touches domain boundary    (ok,can happen)
!                    vi) 0 < w < 1        -->  proper lens and target positions       (ok)
!
!        If the 'w' value is ok, we have to check, if the point (Px,Py,Pz) is actually contained
!        on the domain surface. Again we have here the two cases:
!
!        1) Planar case: We check if the point (Px,Py) is contained in the domain xy-face. The
!           domain xy-face is circular with radius equal to 'xmaxDomain'.
!
!        2) Curved case: We check, if the point (Pz) is contained in the z-range defining the
!           curved domain (i.e. the cylinder height).
!
!        If the 'w' pass these checks, we add this 'w' to the allowed w-list. To find the
!        relevant 'w' we need to pick the smallest 'w' from the allowed w-list. If the list turns
!        out to be empty, then we know that the ray is moving away from or not toughing the domain.
!        This should never happen as the target area is supposed to be entirely contained in the domain.

!     ...loop over all 2D cylindrical blocks and see, if ray is contained in one of it. As soon as
!        that block is found, exit the block loop, since each ray can be assigned to only one block.
!        A 3D ray belongs to a 2D cylindrical block, if its x,z coordinate is such that:
!
!                        x,y block lower limit  <=  ray x,z  <  x,y block upper limit
!
!        except when any of the upper limits of the block coincide with the domain boundaries.
!        In that case the less '<' sign on the right must be replaced by a <= sign, otherwise
!        rays will dissapear and not accounted for, resulting in beam power loss.
!
!        Also note, that the x block lower limit face is never part of the cylindrical domain surface.
!        Hence the reflecting condition must be ignored on this face, otherwise rays hitting exactly
!        by chance this face will be eliminated. The faces that matter in these cases are the
!        y block lower and upper limit block faces.
