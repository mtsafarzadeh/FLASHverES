!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  Traces the movement of the current collection of active rays through one block for
!!  those geometries consisting formally of 1D rectangular grids (cartesian + spherical).
!!  On exit, each ray has either:
!!
!!            i)  reached a different (yet unknown) block
!!           ii)  has been absorbed -> is nonexistent
!!          iii)  has reached the domain boundary and exited -> is nonexistent.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!  timeStep         : current timestep value
!!  rayFirst         : first ray index to be considered
!!  rayLast          : last ray index to be considered
!!  iminBlock        : minimum cell i-index limit defining the interior block
!!  imaxBlock        : maximum cell i-index limit defining the interior block
!!  xminBlock        : minimum x-coordinate limit of the block
!!  xmaxBlock        : maximum x-coordinate limit of the block
!!  deltaInvX        : inverse of the cell's x-dimension
!!  blockReflectMinX : is the block boundary on the minimum x-side reflective ?
!!  blockReflectMaxX : is the block boundary on the maximum x-side reflective ?
!!  cellEnergyDepot  : array collecting the ray energy deposition for each cell
!!
!! NOTES
!!
!!  The code allows for threading to be used on the outer ray trace loop.
!!  The paths of the rays are computed using the geometric optics approximation.

!
!     ...The ray is being refracted through the cell (i). We have to follow its path
!        through the cell and determine its exit cell. At that point the previous cell
!        becomes simply the current cell, that is cell (ip) = cell (i) and the loop
!        is closed.
!
!        Since the ray is moving classically, given an initial position 's0', an initial
!        velocity 'v0' and a constant acceleration 'a', at time 't' we have the new
!        ray position 's' and velocity 'v' given by the equations:
!
!                            s(t) = s0 + v0*t + (a/2)*t^2
!                            v(t) = v0 + a*t
!
!        Note, that s(t) is not the distance travelled by the ray. That would have to
!        be determined by a line integral over the individual s(t)'s. For our purposes
!        we need to find s(t) and v(t) at the position where the ray will exit cell (i).
!        We have to examine, which 't' leads to crossing of a cell face and pick the
!        smallest 't'. This can be done by looking at the quadratic position equation:
!
!                                   A*t^2 + B*t + C = s(t)
!
!        where in our case:
!
!                            A = a/2 = -c^2*grad(ne)/(4*nc)
!                            B = v0
!                            C = s0
!
!        and 'c' is the speed of light, 'ne' the electron density, 'nc' the critical
!        density, 'v0' the initial ray velocity and 's0' the initial ray position. The
!        three quadratic equation coefficients A,B,C stand for the x-components, so
!        we have:
!
!                           Ax * t^2  +  Bx * t  +  Cx  =  sx(t)
!
!        The general equation of a plane (a point here) in 1D space is (E = numerical
!        coefficient):
!
!                                          x = E
!
!        If the ray crosses that point in time 't', then at position sx(t) the point
!        equation is fulfilled, that is:
!
!                                      sx(t) = E
!
!        To find the time it takes to cross that point we now substitute the above
!        quadratic time equation into the point equation. We get
!
!                               Ax * t^2 + Bx * t + Cx = E
!
!        which is a standard quadratic equation in t:
!
!                               Ax * t^2 + Bx * t + (Cx - E) = 0
!
!        Solving this equation gives two possible 't' values. The point will be crossed
!        if 't' is >= 0. The quadratic equation represents actually a set of two different
!        quadratic equations: one for each possible cell face points. We hence have to
!        solve 2 quadratic equations, each giving a pair of t's.
!
!        Significance of the type of t solutions:
!
!          1) t is negative/imaginary -> the ray is moving away from that particular
!                                        cell face point and will not hit it.
!
!          2) t is positive           -> the ray will hit the cell face point in t time.
!
!          3) t is zero               -> the ray is already on the cell face point.
!
!        Among all 't' solutions we need the smallest positive 't' of all 4 possible
!        solutions. The order of the four cell faces is as follows:
!
!                         face 1 -> point of minimum x-axis value 
!                         face 2 -> point of maximum x-axis value
