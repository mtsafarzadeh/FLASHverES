This unit is currently only provided as a stub.
The intention for an information as follows:

For each grid cell, it calculates a column density in any
direction between the cell and the border of the
computational domain (or simply up to some distance). It is
useful for instance for calculating shielding of radiation
needed for simulating formation of moleculs in the ISM. It
provides more or less the same results as the original

but the algorithm is quite different. Nevertheless, it also
uses some healpix subroutines.
