########################### codeCheck class ############################

class checkCode(dict):
   """This class checks a file for coding violations. To add a new 
check add the name of the new violation to the "violations" variable, 
and create methods <violation>_<ext> for each extension for which this
violation applies. This method takes as input a list of strings, 
representing the contents of the file and should return some 
datastructure representing the violations. Usually it is just the list 
of line numbers where the violation occurred. The structure of this 
datastructure should depend only the violation in question.

If the violation does not apply for a certain extension,
you dont have to create the method (or create one which always 
returns [])

Also for each violation you need to create a method <violation>_report 
which takes a list of pairs of (filename, appropriate datastructure) 
and the filename which should contain the report and generate the report 
containing the violations. 

The class also implements fixes. To add a new fix, add a dictionary 
entry to the fixes list, and create a method called fix_<nickname>_<ext> 
where <nickname> is the nickname you gave for the fix, and ext is the 
fileextension to which it should apply. If you define one without the 
_<ext> it will apply to files with all extensions. The method to fix, 
will get as input a list of strings representing the file contents.

It should modify the list in place. The return value should be
None -- if no change was made to the list 1 -- if some change was made 
to the list (so the file will be updated on disk)

The violation/fix dictionaries also support these optional entries:

"exceptions" : if present, should be keyed to a list of regular
expressions by which directories may be excluded from a check. The
violation or fix will not be applied if the directory/file matches a
pattern in the "exceptions" list.

"isComplex" : if present, should be keyed to a method which accepts
a single argument "lines", which represents a list of the lines of
the file being read. If, upon examining "lines" the method returns
True, the file is considered "too complex" and will not be checked
for the violation. The file will appear in a list of complex files
at the beginning of the report.
If no "isComplex" method is provided, this script will use the default
hard-coded "isComplex" method.

"disable": if present, should be keyed to "True". Setting "disable"
simply prevents this violation / fix from being applied to any file.
