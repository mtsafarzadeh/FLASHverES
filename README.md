This version of FLASH code computes ds as a function of s in supersonic isothermal turbulent simulation, 
where s is the over density of cells. 

The analysis folder provides the routine to analyze the output of the simulation.

The Markov folder provides the routine to run an MCMC simulation that reproduces the results 
from the gravo-turbulent simulations.
